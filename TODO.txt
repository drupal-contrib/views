TODO

MAJOR FEATURES
*  Create node-views and do replacements on the URLs. /node/NID/view/VIEWNAME
*  Allow breadcrumb trail to be specified.
*  4.7 forms API and other 4.7 transition requirements.

LESS TIME CONSUMING STUFF
*  Check queries for injection attacks, especially on the URL!
*  Check for enabled modules everywhere
*  Optional [MORE] link in blocks that are also page views.

*  break the form up into distinct functions for each section

*  Titles for summary view

*  Document the API
*  Create a tool to ease creation of default views.
*  Add 'move up, move down, move to top, move to bottom' buttons to make 
   re-ordering easier. 


TO DONE

*  Actually implement the _block and _menu hooks so that views can expose them.
*  Add special handling for non-field data, such as new comments, node changed.
*  Extend table field info: Let admin change header name. 
*  Allow tables to be click-sorted.
*  Each table field and header should have CSS tag.
*  Modify title list to be "List View" and allow the table fields; but instead
   of viewing as a table, it uses a list, with each field in <div> tags allowing
   styling by CSS. Heck, allow ordered/unordered list as an option.
*  Fix themeing to allow each view to be its own theme, if desired. Make sure 
   the support functions exist.
*  get rid of $view->numsorts
*  Try to change hardcoded switch-case statements to callbacks where it
   makes sense to allow modules to extend functionality.
*  Re-factor sorting info so that it goes into the table data and is assembled,
   rather than being hard-coded as it is now.
*  Create on-the-fly filtering too
*  Allow a NOT in the and/or algorithm.
*  description field for view
*  Add changed field to prevent multiple admins from saving views simultaneously
*  query caching
*  redo the $tabledata stuff to generate once and stick it into a well-named
   global for cacheing (this is a prelude to exposing the API).
*  Just put the node information in the full tables section, rather than 3 stupid functions
*  default views
*  Expose an API so modules can provide table and sorting and special
   field-handling information.
*  allow random selection from a view
