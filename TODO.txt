TODO

MAJOR FEATURES
*  Create node-views and do replacements on the URLs. /node/NID/view/VIEWNAME

*  Expose an API so modules can provide table and sorting and special
   field-handling information.

*  Try to change hardcoded switch-case statements to callbacks where it
   makes sense to allow modules to extend functionality.

*  Re-factor sorting info so that it goes into the table data and is assembled,
   rather than being hard-coded as it is now.

*  Allow breadcrumb trail to be specified.

*  Create on-the-fly filtering too

LESS TIME CONSUMING STUFF
*  Add changed field to prevent multiple admins from saving views simultaneously
*  Check queries for injection attacks, especially on the URL!
*  Check for enabled modules everywhere
*  Optional [MORE] link in blocks that are also page views.

*  Add 'move up, move down, move to top, move to bottom' buttons to make 
   re-ordering easier. 

*  The edit/add form could be prettier.

*  Fix themeing to allow each view to be its own theme, if desired. Make sure 
   the support functions exist.

*  Allow a NOT in the and/or algorithm.

TO DONE

*  Actually implement the _block and _menu hooks so that views can expose them.
*  Add special handling for non-field data, such as new comments, node changed.
*  Extend table field info: Let admin change header name. 
*  Allow tables to be click-sorted.
*  Each table field and header should have CSS tag.
*  Modify title list to be "List View" and allow the table fields; but instead
   of viewing as a table, it uses a list, with each field in <div> tags allowing
   styling by CSS. Heck, allow ordered/unordered list as an option.
