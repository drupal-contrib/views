The <strong>fields</strong> row style displays each field defined in the view, one after another. Each field defines its own output.

By default, each field is put in a &lt;div&gt; unless it is selected to be <em>inline</em>. If it is inline, it is put in a &lt;span&gt;. Two items in divs will be displayed one after another, with the second one below the first. Two items in spans will be displayed on the same line. One item in a span next do divs is the same as two items in divs. This means that for the <em>inline</em> setting to do anything, at least two consecutive items must be set inline.

You may define a separator which will be placed between each item. This separator may be html. You can use &amp;nbsp; to print blank space.
