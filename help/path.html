If a display has a path that means that it can be retrieved directly by calling a URL as a first class page on your Drupal site. Any items after the path will be passed into the view as arguments. For example, if the path is <strong>foo/bar</strong> and a user visits <strong>http://www.example.com/foo/bar/baz/beta</strong>, 'baz' and 'beta' will be given as arguments to the view. These can be handled by adding items to the <a href="topic:views/arguments">arguments</a> section.

You may also use placeholders in your path to represent arguments that come in the middle. For example, the path <strong>node/%/someview</strong> would expect the first argument to be the second part of the path. For example, <strong>node/21/someview</strong> would have an argument of '21'.

<em>Note:</em> Views 1 used <strong>$arg</strong> for this kind of thing. $arg is no longer allowed as part of the path. You must use % instead.
