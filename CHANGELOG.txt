         Too drastic to easily deal with. Before you install this version of
	 Views, you should export all your old views as a backup, then drop the
	 views_view table and re-import. Sorry. I hope to not do something like
	 this ever again.
2/19/2006 allow a complete formsapi setting in any 'options' or 'value' setting for 'filter'.
	  Retooled the API to be less hackish.
3/2/2006  Added the ability to expose filters to end user. Requires running update.php.
3/16/2006 Basic user documentation written.
